Properties not utilized in mlp

time delay - takes time to activate

propogation to nearbye astrocytes - are not local units

types of things a network may benefit from as a result:

(old - dead neurons brought back to life, also helps avoid local minima by providing adjustable noise)

new - can propogate signals between neurons not necessarily connected
 - try and create network states? - when to beat fast and when to beat slow based on an external cue

- allow more activity out of a single neuron - increased complexity

- allow for storage of information for longer? like a wave in the astrocytes don't go up or down too fast as a result of neural activity, this could keep informaiton that is super relevant in the network for more time

- could help evolution find optimal solutions by making less solutions where neurons are just dead?

- would it add stochasticity?
